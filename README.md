# Navigation Data of RJDA (Amakusa Airfield, Japan) for MSFS 2020 

This project adds approach data into RJDA which is somehow missing in the default nav database in MSFS2020. You probably won't need this if you're using 3rd party databases like Navigraph.

All approaches are checked using AAU1 Garmin G1000 NXi. Feel free to open an issue should you have any question!

## Reference
